# Beer Right Back

## üç∫ What:

BRB is a simple way to get your friends to mean it when they say "Let's grab a beer" or "I owe you a pint". Our proprietary algorithm (or lack of) ensures that you are able to keep track of who owes you a beer and vice versa.  
In short, It's basically a lending app but with a single currency - a pint of beer.

**TO BUY/OWE A BEER**

- Once you buy a beer for a friend. A ticket/recipe will be issued.
- The ticket/recipe is valid for a period of one month. The recepient must redeem it before it expires
- A user is only allowed to owe a maximum of 5 beers (this is called their 'beer wallet')
- A beer expires 1 month from the day it is given (ability to set this is nice to have)

**TO REDEEM A BEER**

- Simply click the beer time icon and choose redeem. A list of the people who owe you beers will be generated. Pick who to redeem from.
